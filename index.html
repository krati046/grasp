      Built between the 5th century B.C. and the 16th century, the Great Wall
      of China is a stone-and-earth fortification created to protect the borders
      of the Chinese Empire from invading Mongols. The Great Wall is actually a
      succession of multiple walls spanning approximately 4,000 miles, making it
      the world's longest manmade structure.</p></pre></font>

      The Art Deco-style Christ the Redeemer statue has been looming over the
      Brazilians from upon Corcovado mountain in an awe-inspiring state of
      eternal blessing since 1931.The 130-foot reinforced concrete-and-soapstone
      statue was designed by Heitor da Silva Costa and cost approximately
      $250,000 to build - much of the money was raised through donations. The
      statue has become an easily recognized icon for Rio and Brazil.</font></p></pre>

      Machu Picchu, an Incan city of sparkling granite precariously perched
      between 2 towering Andean peaks, is thought by scholars to have been a
      sacred archaeological center for the nearby Incan capital of Cusco.
      Built at the peak of the Incan Empire in the mid-1400s, this mountain
      citadel was later abandoned by the Incas. The site remained unknown
      except to locals until 1911, when it was rediscovered by archaeologist
      Hiram Bingham. The site can only be reached by foot, train or helicopter;
      most visitors visit by train from nearby Cusco.</p></pre></font>

      The genius and adaptability of Mayan culture can be seen in the splendid
      ruins of Chichen Itza. This powerful city, a trading center for cloth,
      slaves, honey and salt, flourished from approximately 800 to 1200, and
      acted as the political and economic hub of the Mayan civilization.The
      most familiar ruin at the site is El Caracol, a sophisticated astronomical
      observatory.</p></pre></font>

      Rome's, if not Italy's, most enduring icon is undoubtedly its Colosseum.
      Built between A.D. 70 and 80 A.D., it was in use for some 500 years.
      The elliptical structure sat nearly50,000 spectators, who gathered to
      watch the gladiatorial events as well as other public spectacles,including
      battle reenactments, animal hunts and executions. Earthquakes and stone-
      robbers have the Colosseum in a state of ruin, but portions of the
      structure remain open to tourists, and its design still influences the
      construction of modern-day amphitheaters, some 2,000 years later.</p></pre></font>

      Declared a World Heritage Site in 1985, Petra was the capital of the
       Nabataean empire of King Aretas IV, and likely existed in its
       primefrom 9 B.C. to A.D. 40. The membersof this civilization proved
       to be early experts in manipulating water technology, constructing
       intricatetunnels and water chambers, which helped create an pseudo-
       oasis. A number of incredible structures carveinto stone, a 4,000-seat
       amphitheater and the El-Deir monastery have also helped the site earn
       its fame.</p></pre></font>
